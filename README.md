# Bitcoin-days
Bitcoin Days is an innovative NFT project using a unique NFTree structure to support scholars and Clarity apprentices through donations from NFT sales. The project is designed to be decentralized, operating without a CEO and open to anyone interested in contributing, whether through artistic collaboration, launching a project to fund a scholar, or acquiring one of the 21 root NFTs. Root NFT holders participate in scholar selection and receive rewards from the protocol treasury, but if they fail to vote, their NFT may be sold by the protocol. Bitcoin Days encourages artistic growth and collaboration while fulfilling its charitable mission in a decentralized manner, empowering the community to drive its development and impact.
