# Bitcoin-days
Bitcoin Days is an NFT project with a unique NFTree structure, supporting scholars &amp; Clarity apprentices via donations from NFT sales. The 21 root NFTs vote on scholars, earning rewards from the treasury; if they don't vote, their NFT is sold. The project fosters artistic collaboration and growth while fulfilling its charitable mission.
